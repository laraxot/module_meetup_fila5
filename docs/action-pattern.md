# Action Pattern Documentation

## Overview
The Laravel Pizza project extensively uses the action pattern for business logic implementation, following the "Action-Domain-Responder" (ADR) pattern. This approach centralizes business logic in single-method classes, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.

## Core Concepts

### Action Pattern Benefits
- Single responsibility: Each action class has one purpose
- Reusability: Actions can be used across different contexts
- Testability: Easy to unit test individual business operations
- Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns
- Queueability: Actions can be queued using spatie/queueable-action

### Queueable Actions
Many actions in the project implement the QueueableAction trait, allowing them to be processed asynchronously:
- Improves performance for time-consuming operations
- Provides better user experience
- Supports retry mechanisms
- Enables distributed processing

## Action Structure

### Standard Action Template
```php
<?php

namespace Modules\{Module}\Actions\{Domain};

use Spatie\QueueableAction\QueueableAction;

class {ActionName}Action
{
    use QueueableAction;

    public function execute({parameters}): {return_type}
    {
        // Business logic implementation
    }
}
```

### Common Patterns
- Actions typically return the model they operated on
- Actions handle their own transactions when needed
- Actions implement proper error handling
- Actions follow consistent naming conventions

## Integration Points

### With Models
- Actions often create, update, or delete model instances
- Proper model validation before persistence
- Transaction handling for data integrity
- Event dispatching after operations

### With Authentication
- Actions respect user authentication
- Authorization checks when required
- User context tracking
- Audit trail maintenance

### With Event Sourcing
- Actions may trigger domain events
- Integration with Activity module
- State change tracking
- Audit trail creation

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- Action classes end with "Action"
- Use imperative verbs (Create, Update, Delete, Process)
- Include domain context in namespace
- Clear and descriptive names

### Error Handling
- Proper exception handling
- Meaningful error messages
- Rollback mechanisms when needed
- Logging of important failures

### Transaction Management
- Use database transactions for consistency
- Proper isolation levels
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Performance considerations

## Testing Actions

### Unit Testing
- Test business logic in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Verify expected outcomes
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Integration Testing
- Test with real database
- Verify transaction behavior
- Check event dispatching
- Validate authorization

## Performance Considerations

### Queueable Actions
- Identify time-consuming operations
- Proper queue configuration
- Error handling and retry logic
- Monitoring and observability

### Database Operations
- Optimize queries within actions
- Use eager loading when appropriate
- Consider pagination for large datasets
- Cache expensive operations when possible

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Validate all input parameters
- Sanitize user-provided data
- Prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper type checking

### Authorization
- Verify user permissions
- Check resource ownership
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Implement proper access controls

## Common Action Categories

### CRUD Actions
- Create{Entity}Action
- Update{Entity}Action
- Delete{Entity}Action
- Get{Entity}Action

### Business Process Actions
- Process{Workflow}Action
- Execute{Task}Action
- Handle{Event}Action
- Validate{Entity}Action

### Integration Actions
- Sync{ExternalService}Action
- Notify{Channel}Action
- Import{Data}Action
- Export{Data}Action

This pattern provides a clean, maintainable architecture that scales well with the modular structure of the Laravel Pizza project.
