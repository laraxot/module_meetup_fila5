## Integration Points

### 1. Layout Integration
- Use the existing theme's layout components in Meetup module views
- Ensure consistent navigation between Meetup features and other site sections
- Implement proper SEO meta tags for event pages

### 2. Component Reusability
- Leverage existing UI components from the UI module
- Create new components specific to the Meetup functionality
- Ensure responsive design across all event-related pages

### 3. Styling Consistency
- Use the theme's CSS framework and design tokens
- Follow the existing color palette and typography
- Implement dark mode support if available in the theme

### 4. JavaScript Integration
- Integrate calendar functionality with the theme's JS structure
- Implement AJAX for event registration without page reloads
- Ensure proper asset loading and dependency management

## Module-Theme Communication

### View Rendering
The Meetup module should use the theme's view resolution system:

```php
// In Meetup module controllers
return view('meetup::pages.events.index'); // This will look for the view in the Meetup theme
```

### Configuration
Ensure the Meetup module respects theme configurations:

```php
// Use theme configurations
$themeConfig = config('theme.meetup');
$calendarSettings = $themeConfig['calendar'] ?? [];
```

### Asset Management
- Publish module-specific assets that integrate with the theme
- Use Vite for asset building (following existing Laravel Vite integration)
- Ensure proper caching and versioning of assets

## User Experience Considerations
